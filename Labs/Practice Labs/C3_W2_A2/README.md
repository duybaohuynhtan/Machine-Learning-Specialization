# Deep Learning for Content-Based Filtering

In this exercise, you will implement content-based filtering using a neural network to build a recommender system for movies.

## 1 - Movie ratings dataset

The data set is derived from the [MovieLens ml-latest-small](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/) dataset. 

[F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. 2015. The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TiiS) 5, 4: 19:1â€“19:19. <https://doi.org/10.1145/2827872>]

The original dataset has roughly 9000 movies rated by 600 users with ratings on a scale of 0.5 to 5 in 0.5 step increments. The dataset has been reduced in size to focus on movies from the years since 2000 and popular genres. The reduced dataset has $n_u = 397$ users, $n_m= 847$ movies and 25521 ratings. For each movie, the dataset provides a movie title, release date, and one or more genres. For example "Toy Story 3" was released in 2010 and has several genres: "Adventure|Animation|Children|Comedy|Fantasy". This dataset contains little information about users other than their ratings. This dataset is used to create training vectors for the neural networks described below. 
Let's learn a bit more about this data set. The table below shows the top 10 movies ranked by the number of ratings. These movies also happen to have high average ratings. How many of these movies have you watched?

## 2 - Content-based filtering with a neural network

In the collaborative filtering lab, you generated two vectors, a user vector and an item/movie vector whose dot product would predict a rating. The vectors were derived solely from the ratings.   

Content-based filtering also generates a user and movie feature vector but recognizes there may be other information available about the user and/or movie that may improve the prediction. The additional information is provided to a neural network which then generates the user and movie vector as shown below.
