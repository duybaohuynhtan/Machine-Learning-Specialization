# Neural Networks for Handwritten Digit Recognition, Multiclass 

In this exercise, you will use a neural network to recognize the hand-written digits 0-9.

## Neural Networks

In last weeks assignment, you implemented a neural network to do binary classification. This week you will extend that to multiclass classification. This will utilize the softmax activation.


### Problem Statement

In this exercise, you will use a neural network to recognize ten handwritten digits, 0-9. This is a multiclass classification task where one of n choices is selected. Automated handwritten digit recognition is widely used today - from recognizing zip codes (postal codes) on mail envelopes to recognizing amounts written on bank checks.
