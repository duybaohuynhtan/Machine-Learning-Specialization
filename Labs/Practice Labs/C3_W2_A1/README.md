# Collaborative Filtering Recommender Systems

In this exercise, you will implement collaborative filtering to build a recommender system for movies. 

## 1 - Notation

|General <br />  Notation  | Description| Python (if any) |
|:-------------|:------------------------------------------------------------||
| $r(i,j)$     | scalar; = 1  if user j rated movie i  = 0  otherwise             ||
| $y(i,j)$     | scalar; = rating given by user j on movie  i    (if r(i,j) = 1 is defined) ||
|$\mathbf{w}^{(j)}$ | vector; parameters for user j ||
|$b^{(j)}$     |  scalar; parameter for user j ||
| $\mathbf{x}^{(i)}$ |   vector; feature ratings for movie i        ||     
| $n_u$        | number of users |num_users|
| $n_m$        | number of movies | num_movies |
| $n$          | number of features | num_features                    |
| $\mathbf{X}$ |  matrix of vectors $\mathbf{x}^{(i)}$         | X |

## 2 - Recommender Systems

In this lab, you will implement the collaborative filtering learning algorithm and apply it to a dataset of movie ratings.
The goal of a collaborative filtering recommender system is to generate two vectors: For each user, a 'parameter vector' that embodies the movie tastes of a user. For each movie, a feature vector of the same size which embodies some description of the movie. The dot product of the two vectors plus the bias term should produce an estimate of the rating the user might give to that movie.

The diagram below details how these vectors are learned.

Existing ratings are provided in matrix form as shown. $Y$ contains ratings; 0.5 to 5 inclusive in 0.5 steps. 0 if the movie has not been rated. $R$ has a 1 where movies have been rated. Movies are in rows, users in columns. Each user has a parameter vector $w^{user}$ and bias. Each movie has a feature vector $x^{movie}$. These vectors are simultaneously learned by using the existing user/movie ratings as training data. One training example is shown above: $\mathbf{w}^{(1)} \cdot \mathbf{x}^{(1)} + b^{(1)} = 4$. It is worth noting that the feature vector $x^{movie}$ must satisfy all the users while the user vector $w^{user}$ must satisfy all the movies. This is the source of the name of this approach - all the users collaborate to generate the rating set.

Once the feature vectors and parameters are learned, they can be used to predict how a user might rate an unrated movie. This is shown in the diagram above. The equation is an example of predicting a rating for user one on movie zero.


In this exercise, you will implement the function `cofiCostFunc` that computes the collaborative filtering
objective function. After implementing the objective function, you will use a TensorFlow custom training loop to learn the parameters for collaborative filtering. The first step is to detail the data set and data structures that will be used in the lab.

## 3 - Movie ratings dataset

The data set is derived from the [MovieLens "ml-latest-small"](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/) dataset.   
[F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. 2015. The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TiiS) 5, 4: 19:1â€“19:19. <https://doi.org/10.1145/2827872>]

The original dataset has  9000 movies rated by 600 users. The dataset has been reduced in size to focus on movies from the years since 2000. This dataset consists of ratings on a scale of 0.5 to 5 in 0.5 step increments. The reduced dataset has $n_u = 443$ users, and $n_m= 4778$ movies. 

Below, you will load the movie dataset into the variables $Y$ and $R$.

The matrix $Y$ (a  $n_m \times n_u$ matrix) stores the ratings $y^{(i,j)}$. The matrix $R$ is an binary-valued indicator matrix, where $R(i,j) = 1$ if user $j$ gave a rating to movie $i$, and $R(i,j)=0$ otherwise. 

Throughout this part of the exercise, you will also be working with the
matrices, $\mathbf{X}$, $\mathbf{W}$ and $\mathbf{b}$: 

$$\mathbf{X} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
--- (\mathbf{x}^{(0)})^T --- \\
--- (\mathbf{x}^{(1)})^T --- \\
\vdots \\
--- (\mathbf{x}^{(n_m-1)})^T --- \\
\end{bmatrix} , \quad
\mathbf{W} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
--- (\mathbf{w}^{(0)})^T --- \\
--- (\mathbf{w}^{(1)})^T --- \\
\vdots \\
--- (\mathbf{w}^{(n_u-1)})^T --- \\
\end{bmatrix},\quad
\mathbf{ b} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
 b^{(0)}  \\
 b^{(1)} \\
\vdots \\
b^{(n_u-1)} \\
\end{bmatrix}\quad
$$ 

The $i$-th row of $\mathbf{X}$ corresponds to the
feature vector $x^{(i)}$ for the $i$-th movie, and the $j$-th row of
$\mathbf{W}$ corresponds to one parameter vector $\mathbf{w}^{(j)}$, for the
$j$-th user. Both $x^{(i)}$ and $\mathbf{w}^{(j)}$ are $n$-dimensional
vectors. For the purposes of this exercise, you will use $n=10$, and
therefore, $\mathbf{x}^{(i)}$ and $\mathbf{w}^{(j)}$ have 10 elements.
Correspondingly, $\mathbf{X}$ is a
$n_m \times 10$ matrix and $\mathbf{W}$ is a $n_u \times 10$ matrix.

We will start by loading the movie ratings dataset to understand the structure of the data.
We will load $Y$ and $R$ with the movie dataset.  
We'll also load $\mathbf{X}$, $\mathbf{W}$, and $\mathbf{b}$ with pre-computed values. These values will be learned later in the lab, but we'll use pre-computed values to develop the cost model.
