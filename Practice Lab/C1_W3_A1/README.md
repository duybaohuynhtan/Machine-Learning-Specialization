# Logistic Regression

In this exercise, you will implement logistic regression and apply it to two different datasets.

## 1 - Logistic Regression

In this part of the exercise, you will build a logistic regression model to predict whether a student gets admitted into a university.

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Suppose that you are the administrator of a university department and you want to determine each applicant’s chance of admission based on their results on two exams. 
* You have historical data from previous applicants that you can use as a training set for logistic regression. 
* For each training example, you have the applicant’s scores on two exams and the admissions decision. 
* Your task is to build a classification model that estimates an applicant’s probability of admission based on the scores from those two exams.

## 2 - Regularized Logistic Regression

In this part of the exercise, you will implement regularized logistic regression to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance (QA). During QA, each microchip goes through various tests to ensure it is functioning correctly.

### 2.1 Problem Statement

Suppose you are the product manager of the factory and you have the test results for some microchips on two different tests. 
- From these two tests, you would like to determine whether the microchips should be accepted or rejected. 
- To help you make the decision, you have a dataset of test results on past microchips, from which you can build a logistic regression model.
