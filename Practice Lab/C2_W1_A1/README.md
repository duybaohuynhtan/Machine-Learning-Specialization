# Neural Networks for Handwritten Digit Recognition, Binary

In this exercise, you will use a neural network to recognize the hand-written digits zero and one.

## Neural Networks

In Course 1, you implemented logistic regression. This was extended to handle non-linear boundaries using polynomial regression. For even more complex scenarios such as image recognition, neural networks are preferred.

### Problem Statement

In this exercise, you will use a neural network to recognize two handwritten digits, zero and one. This is a binary classification task. Automated handwritten digit recognition is widely used today - from recognizing zip codes (postal codes) on mail envelopes to recognizing amounts written on bank checks. You will extend this network to recognize all 10 digits (0-9) in a future assignment. 

This exercise will show you how the methods you have learned can be used for this classification task.
